                        keeping an existing representation of data while adding automated redrawing and some interactivity.
                        Our team quickly realized the limited potential of this modality.</ul>

                            ‘sunburst’ visualization.  A data representation ideal for incongruent data sets such as medical school curriculum.
                            An additional, major consideration was the clients existing curriculum system utilized
                            JSON data-interchange format allowing direct integration into the client’s system. </ul>

                                layered and displayed. We began working rapid prototypes to better understand the workings of the d3.js
                                (JavaScript) code and the provide client prototypes. Analyzing the structure of data generated from
                                the clients existing system and interviewing stakeholders we settled on creating a “4-layer path,”
                                from Program to Cohort to Competency and finally to Course level.
                                Allowing students to understand how each course fits with core curricular competency. </ul>

                                    The sunburst originally used JSON, however the default data model for Ilios is a Javascript file.
                                    The visualization had to use the data model provided by the client, to overcome this challenge our
                                    team modified the Sunburst model to accept Javascript files.</ul>

                                    The visualization is built using Ember a JS framework that the clients Ilios Curriculum Manager application is
                                    built on. The visualization utlizes the D3 Javascript library,
                                    specifically the Zoomable Sunburst. The Sunburst is a hierarchical tree map
                                    using a radial layout. The first layer, the root node, is the innermost layer of the
                                    Sunburst. From there, it is a hierarchical visualization using paths.</ul>
