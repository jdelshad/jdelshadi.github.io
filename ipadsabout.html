                            and a review of existing literature we sought to address some of these questions:</b></h4>
                            <li>How and why are students using iPads with patient actors?</li>
                            <li>What are some standardized, codifiable ways to measure doctor-patient interaction?</li>

                              range of events that occurs within an encounter was the main challenge in addressing our
                              prevailing questions. Our team began with loosely structured note taking, with instruction
                              to focus on patient perceived ability to view the iPad screen, verbal consent to use the
                              device, narration of iPad use and instances where issues with familiarity and fluidity were
                              observed. Criteria guided by both UC Irvine’s iPad use guidelines and by literature
                              relating to electronic health records usage with patients.

                          <h6> Transition from Unstructed to Coded Pratice</h6>

                          <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
                              <p class="prg"> <ul> After multiple evolution of our coding scheme, the categories were
                                simplified to focus on more measureable impacts to the patient experience, including length
                                of interaction, seating arrangement between doctor and patient, number of medical illustrations
                                used in patient education and whether the iPad was used in consecutive and in internal periods.
                                These categories were captured on standardized coding sheet that our reacher team filled as we
                                individually watched encounter videos. To test reliability of this scheme each researcher watched
                                a test set of ten videos and results were compared across each researcher set. Unable to
                                establish reliability in the coding scheme after several
                                more iterations of the coding sheet, we moved to a double coding practice</ul>

                              <div style="text-align: center;">

                                    In double coding practice the video set was divided among four researches
                                    with each video being view by at least two researchers. Each would watch the
                                    assigned video independently filling out the coding sheet. Then the two would
                                    collaboratively watch the video comparing coding results and come to agreement
                                    on action timing, the inclusion of events during the encounter and to ensure accuracy
                                    of the quantitative measures collected. Agreement practice involved combining accounts of
                                    actions that occurred in a three to five second window of one another. The purpose of the
                                    double coding practice was to ensure reproducible video coding results, in a manner that
                                    is difficult to produce with a single viewing coding method.

                                <div style="text-align: center;">
                                  <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">

                                    <p class="prg"><ul><h4><b>Through discussions with
                                      stakeholders,focus groups with student doctors
                                      and a review of existing literature we sought to address some of these questions:</b></h4>
                                      <li>In this study we found the most significant variable in the exam room to be the seating arrangement between doctor-patient.
                                        Almost none of the student doctors rearranged seating in the room, using the room as is.
                                        Leaving the iPad far from the patient and creating difficult view angles in most changes.
                                        Starting this study we expected eye-contact, issues the iPad itself or a lack of training
                                        to have the most impact on the patient experience. Often the conditions surrounding
                                        technology, like the setup of the exam room, are more impactful that the technology itself. </li>
                                      </br><img class="present" src="suftit/SURF-IT (2).jpg" alt=""></br>

                                      <li>Lab results presented on the device versus on paper was another important element
                                        contributing to the most ‘successful’ uses of the iPad. In our exploratory study, student were
                                        given paper results, later in the double coded portion of our study results were only delivered
                                        via iPad. This forced the student doctors to integrate the iPad further and orient themselves
                                        close to the patient due to finer details of a lab results sheet. Commitment to a single form
                                        factor can create a more integrated , focused experience for both primary
                                        and secondary users of technology in the exam room and perhaps in other analogous spaces. </li>
                                      <li>Broadly, I have come to understand the creation and validation of a research methodology can be the most laborious and important part of a research study. </li>
                                    </ul>
