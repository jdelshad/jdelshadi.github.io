                    <p>I was asked by staff at UC Irvine's New Student Orientation to design a cover for their Tranfer Success Program, we went through a few iteration of the design but the final product turned out better than I expected. The theme of this years is "Evergreen" and the includes a quote from <a href="http://www.tutufoundation-usa.org/exhibitions.html">Desmond Tutu.</a> Which I had orginally left out in the first iteration. I am generally not a fan of block quotes, but breaking it up seems to work here.</a></p>
