                    <li>For one year I served as the elected representative for 23,000 undergraduates serving as the chief advocate for all matters impacting student life on campus, an effort that involved overseeing a portfolio of weekly, quarter and year long programs.</li>
                    <li>As the Internal Vice President, I trained and supervised staff of 85+ students working on projects dedicated to improving student life including volunteerism, accessibility, wellness, conservation and other.</li>
                    <li>Together with a team of four other executives, we created, balanced a yearly budget of approximately a $1.5 million for campus programming and advocacy projects.</li>
                    <li>For this portfolio I will deal the effortd involved in the planning and coordination of key projects, including the creation and execution of "UC I Give Back", a large scale service event and artLab, an art and design space aimed at permanently installing student art across campus.</li>

                  <h2>Program Context</h2>
                  <div style="text-align: center;">
                     <div style="display: block; text-align: justify">
                  <p class="prg"> <ul> This retrofit involved the near complete overhaul of a Boeing 747-400 with over
                    four hundred seats in three classes all completed at a maintenance and operations facility in China.
                    To add the complexity of this project,
      the customer requested to reuse some inflight entertainment for a select class of seats.
      The entire project was completed in a compressed timeframe,
       nearly half the normal alloated time from sale to delivery. This "short flow" necessitated
       high degree of cross functional coordination between our project management team and manufacturing, engineering, software and installation groups.</ul>
                  </p></div></div>
                </br>
                  <img class=present3 src="img/PAC-page2.png" alt="">

                  <div style="text-align: center;">
                     <div style="display: block; text-align: left">
                  <p class="prg"> <ul>During this project, and at any given moment, I work on the management of at least
                    15 to 20 programs for Multiple European airlines, all at various stages of completion. During my time in program
                    management I have contributed to more than twenty-four programs, nearing thousand hours of project
                    management experience. As a Program Administrator, I work on a daily basis with a Program Manager
                    to oversee each component of a program. At each stage the Program Team
                    (Program Manager and Program Administrator) collaborate to move accomplish each stage. </ul>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
               <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
            <p class="prg"> <ul>
            Working with my program manager while they were at the retrofit location in China, was a
            significant challenge. Critical information was delayed by "one day,"by the time I received
            the action and began work we were already behind by one working day. A hurdle compounded the
            almost twenty-hour days, six-day a week schedule by which most retrofits are conducted.</ul>
            </p>

            <p class="prg"> <ul>
              Retrofit present an added challenge, in that most engineering work is done based on
              existing drawing and documentation. A few time during installation a cable was found
              to be time too short or a part was not created quite to specification. Recreating or
              procuring a part that takes month to manufacture is no easy feat. Lastly, this was my
              first Panasonic Program, I did not have the experience that would help in a short flow
              retrofit like this one.</ul>
            </p></div></div>
            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
               <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
            <p class="prg"><ul>
                <li>For this project I was fortunate enough to work with an experienced program manager who had functional experience
                in engineering. Which allowed him to effectively communicate onsite issue and assist in their resolution.
              Demonstrating the importance of cross functional experience on a project team.</li>
                <li>During and after this project I realized the importance of learning how others work.
                  By this I mean not only the individual habits of your team, but understanding how your
                  supplier manufactures seats or what the dynamic of your software development work. This
                  type of understand can help prioritize your efforts and answers questions like:<ul><li> Can I
                  leave this team relatively unattended to complete their work? </li>
                  <li>Do we have build more time into the schedule considering past overruns?</li></ul>
                <li>At the start of this program I had almost no experience with aviation program management, I was able to
                contribute and learn quickly by listening carefully and contributing only once I was able to speak with some
              authority regarding the on goings of the program.</li>
            </ul></p></div></div>
 <h2>Final Result</h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
       <div style="display: block; text-align: justify">
    <p class="prg"> <ul> This program was delivered on-time, the customer was satisfied with this end result. This aircraft continues to fly from Europe all around the world. Our program team followed this program with another retrofit with an additional eight aircraft.</ul>
