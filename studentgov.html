                          a partnering organization that met our goal to impact a large area of
                          the Orange County and provide undergraduates with the opportunity to

                        directly with students in elementary and middle schools through after-school
                        programs that reach underserved students. Their programs often recruit UCI
                        students who are looking to gain experience in child education. In order to
                        improve UC I Giveback over its inaugural year, we created a committee consisting
                        of students, THINK Together staff, and UC Irvine event planning staff to foster
                        direct collaboration, buy-in, and understanding between all stakeholders. This
                        committee determined it was necessary to improve training for volunteers, expand
                        and optimize transportation networks, along with other minor improvements.

                          UC I Giveback was a recent addition to campus programming, meaning funding from the Associated Students budget was nonexistent. Our the event relied completely on sponsorships and donations, requiring negotiations with different parties and modifying the event to meet specific funding requirements. I created a proposal and met with various campus partners including Dining and Hospitality, Parking and Transportation, the Green Initiative Fund, and others to secure grants to sustain our program.  </ul>

                              We worked with THINK Together and two bussing companies to schedule transport between UCI and the 48 schools across Orange County. By delegating specific routes and volunteer cohorts to each of 13 core event staff members, I oversaw the successful transport of over 250 volunteers and support staff to their respective service sites, successfully mitigating the impact of unexpected obstacles (including bus delays, a car accident) by maintaining clear lines of communication between well-trained leadership staff.</ul>

                                  Though the event attracted less volunteers than planned the program reached a record number
                                  of schools and local students. Additionally, this event generated thousands of hours of
                                  community service while kicking off a services of smaller scale continuous service events.
                                  Lastly many participants continued to go back to the
                                  school site to volunteer, or began to pursue careers in education.</ul>

                                    <p class="prg"> <ul> ArtLab is a year-round project that involved quarterly events and a year
                                      long advocacy agenda broadly centered at promoting and engaging all students in art and advocating
                                      for permanent student art spaces. Going into its third year, artLab was struggling and slated to be canceled.
                                      The programs difficulties were caused by a failure to meaningfully engage the artistic student community and lost
                                      its effectiveness to promote artists to the general student body. We instead put together a team that conducted
                                      outreach to existing clubs and departments dedicated to art, performance,
                                      and design. These efforts ‘turned around’ this program and has allowed it to continue till this day.

                                At an institution already equipped with strong programs in STEM education and research, it was critical
                                to create an accessible, student-run space that highlights not only the importance of art and design, but
                                also the interdisciplinary nature of artistic expression. We rebranded artLab’s showcases by developing
                                quarterly themes for each event in order to engage specific artistic communities and boost consistent attendance
                                among the general student body. The events were staged in an open space on an outdoor terrace, between the
                                academic core of campus and student meeting and the main entry point of campus. This design allowed for an
                                accidental encounter with the space,
                                it also allowed created a natural transition between two elements realms of the student experience. </ul>

Initially it took some effort to obtain sponsorship and funding for this event, overtime the event itself attracted more sponsorship and involvement requests than we were able to accommodate. artLab has continued to evolved over the last two years, tackling a variety of social issues and creative motifs. The program continues to thrive today.</ul>
